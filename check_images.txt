Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: 
Yes, all three correctly classified the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg as "dog"

2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: 
Yes, all three correctly classified the breed of dog in Dog_02.jpg as "dog"

3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: 
Yes, all three model architectures correctly classified Macaw_01.jpg as "macaw" and Violin_01.jpg as "violin".

4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer:
None of the architectures misclassified any of the uploaded images and all correctly identified the dog breed, therefore I am unable to make a conclusion on the basis of this small sample of data.
However based on the results of the classification of the pet_images directory (Final Results below), the VGG architecture was the most successful both in categorising dog images as dogs and in correctly identifying the breed of dog.

Final Results
Total Images: 40.
Dog Images: 30.
Not-a-dog Images: 10.

CNN Model Architecture	% Correct Not-a-dog	% Correct Dog	% Correct Breed	% Match Labels
